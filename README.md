# DAV_Assignment(151)
**Estimation of Obesity Levels Based On Eating Habits and Physical Condition:**
This repository contains a Python-based analysis of the "Estimation of Obesity Levels Based On Eating Habits and Physical Condition" dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The analysis is performed using a Google Colab notebook.

## Repository Contents

* `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project.
* `DAV_Assignment(151).ipynb`: The Google Colab notebook containing the Python analysis.
* `Obesity_levels_estimation.csv`: The raw dataset used for the analysis.


## Dataset

The dataset, `Obesity_levels_estimation.csv`, is sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository:

[UCI Machine Learning Repository Link](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/544/estimation+of+obesity+levels+based+on+eating+habits+and+physical+condition)

It includes features related to eating habits, physical condition, and socioeconomic factors to estimate obesity levels.

## Google Colab Notebook (`DAV_Assignment(151).ipynb`)

The notebook performs the following key steps:

1.  **Data Loading & Inspection:** Loads and examines the dataset.
2.  **Data Cleaning:** Handles missing values and encodes categorical features.
3.  **Data Analysis:** Conducts various analyses using NumPy and Pandas, including slicing, universal functions, aggregations, boolean masking, sorting, structured arrays, hierarchical indexing, basic statistics, filtering, grouping, and pivot tables.
4.  **Data Visualization:** Creates plots using Matplotlib and Seaborn to visualize data distributions and relationships.
5.  **Advanced NumPy Operations:** Demonstrates advanced NumPy functionalities like normalization, boolean indexing, creating new features (BMI), grouping, merging, and pivot tables.

## How to Run

Open and run the `DAV_Assignment(151).ipynb` file in Google Colab. Ensure that the `Obesity_levels_estimation.csv` file is accessible in the same environment.Run the cells in the notebook sequentially.
